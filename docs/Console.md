### Work with the console

With the console page you can monitor the activities of your system and send your 
own commands to the SIM808 module.

You can set the level of detail using the **Debug Active** option.

Note: To communicate with the SIM808 module this must be switched on

If you want to send your own AT commands to the SIM808 it is advisable to deactivate the 
SMS, GPS and MQTT functions under Settings during this time, otherwise they may interfere 
with your commands.
