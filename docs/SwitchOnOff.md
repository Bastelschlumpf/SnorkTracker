### Switch on/off

   ![Switch on off](../images/OnOff.png "Switch on off")

You can switch on or switch off the system with the first button on the main page.

On/Off only affects GPS, SMS and MQTT functions (if enabled).
The ambient sensor independently checks the temperature, air pressure and humidity 
after the set time interval.

When switching on the GSM function it may happen that the system does not react 
for a short time. The simplest way to monitor that no errors occur is to switch 
to the console view immediately after switching on and display the communication.
